💡 Project Overview:
This application is a lightweight, console-driven Employee Management System built purely in Python. It allows users to efficiently manage employee records through a simple and intuitive interface. All data is persistently stored in a local text file, eliminating the need for complex databases while maintaining functionality and performance.

🔍 Key Features:
1. 👤 Add Employee Record:
Users can input essential employee details such as name, age, designation, and salary. The application stores each record in a structured format within a local file. Data validation is applied to ensure accuracy and reliability.
